      <h1>Marvel and the Nazis</h1>
      <p>The drama of World War II also played itself out in the adventures of the golden-era
         comic books. Many of Captain Marvel's adventures were based on thwarting nefarious
         plots hatched by Nazis and Nazi sympathizers. The most prominent of Captain 
         Marvel's opponents in this regard was certainly <a href="#">Captain Nazi</a>.</p>
      <p>Captain Nazi was a genetically altered "super soldier" given superhuman strength,
         stamina, and the ability to fly. Acting as a Adolph Hitler's champion, Captain
         Nazi was sent personally by the fuhrer to do battle with America's superheroes
         including both Captain Marvel and <a href="#">Bulletman</a>. He made in last
         appearance in a Fawcett comic book in 1944 but was later revised his role in
         several DC Comics reboots of the Captain Marvel franchise.</p>
      <p>The <a href="#">Monster Society of Evil</a> was home to several infamous characters
         from the Second World War. Adolph Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Tojo.
         were charters members, along with other prominent Nazis and war criminals. 
         One of the schemes hatched by the society involved using
         Captain Nazi to steal magic fortune-telling pearls from an Egyptian princess.
         Another plot saw the society attempting to use a giant cannon to blow holes in
         various countries across the world. In all of these schemes, Captain Marvel was
         always there to save the day for the freedom-loving countries of the world.</p>

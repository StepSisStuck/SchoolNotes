# Objectives of this course

- Understand the digital forensics investigation process
- Explain the importance of digital evidence and the role between public and private sector
- Explaining the importance of maintaining professional conduct

# Overview of Digital Forensics Investigation Process
- The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) governs the admissibility of evidence in federal courts.
- FBI Computer Analysis and Response Team (CART) is a group of FBI agents who specialize in computer forensics.
- By late 1990s, the FBI had established regional computer forensics laboratories (RCFLs) to provide computer forensic services to local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.

## The Fourth Amendment
- The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures.
    - The Fourth Amendment applies to government agents, not private citizens.
    - The Fourth Amendment does not apply to searches conducted by private citizens or organizations.
  
# Understanding Case Law 
- Existing case law provides guidance on the admissibility of digital evidence.
- When statutes (a written law passed by a legislative body) do not exist, case law provides guidance on the admissibility of digital evidence.
- Examiners must be familiar with case law to ensure that evidence is admissible in court.

# Developing Digital Forensics Resources
- Learn about the resources available to you as a digital forensics examiner.
- Join computer forensics organizations.
   - Example: Computer Technology Investigators Network (CTIN)
   - Example: High Technology Crime Investigation Association (HTCIA)
   - Example: International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners (ISFCE)
   - Example: International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists (IACIS)

## Digital investigation falls into two categories:
- Public sector Investigation
- Private sector Investigation

# Preparing for Digital Forensics Investigation
## Public Sector Investigation
- **Public sector** investigations are conducted by government agencies.
- Be familiar with the laws that govern your jurisdiction.
- Be familiar with the laws that govern the jurisdiction where the evidence was collected.
- The Department of Justice (DOJ) has published a guide for searching and seizing computers and obtaining electronic evidence in criminal investigations.


### Following Legal Procedures
- The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) governs the admissibility of evidence in federal courts.
- A Criminal Investigation is an investigation conducted by a law enforcement agency or when someone finds evidence of or witnesses a crime.
- Police Interviews and Interrogations
    - An interview is a conversation between a police officer and a person who is not a suspect.
    - An interrogation is a conversation between a police officer and a person who is a suspect.

- Report is processed and management decides whether to pursue the case or log the information  in a police blotter.
   - A police blotter is a log of arrests and other events in the daily operations of a police station.

- **Digital Evicence First Responder (DEFR)** is a person who is trained to identify, collect, preserve, and transport digital evidence.
- **Digital Evidence Specialist (DES)** has the skills to analyze the evidence when another specialist should be called in.
- **Affidavit** is a written statement of facts that is sworn or affirmed to be true.
   - Must include **exhibit** that is a document or other item introduced as evidence during a trial.

- **Chain of custody** is a written record of all people who have had possession of an item of evidence.

- **Search warrant** is a court order that authorizes law enforcement officers to search a particular area or property and seize items of evidence.

- **Subpoena** is a court order that requires a person to appear in court to testify.

- **Civil investigation** is an investigation conducted by a private investigator or a private organization.

## Understanding Private-Sector Investigations
- Private sector investigations are conducted by private investigators or private organizations or law firms who address **company policy violations** or **litigation**.
    - Example
        - Wrongful termination
        - Sexual harassment
        - Intellectual property theft
        - Fraud
        - Divorce
        - Child custody
        - Insurance claims

- Business strive to minimize the risk of litigation by implementing policies and procedures that address the following:
    - Employee privacy
    - Employee monitoring
    - Employee Internet usage
    - Employee e-mail usage
    - Employee computer usage
    - Employee social media usage
    - Employee mobile device usage
    - Employee data storage
    - Employee data retention
    - Employee data disposal

- Private-sector crimes can be involve:
   - **Email Harassment**. Sending threatening or harassing email messages.
   - **Email Bombing**. Sending a massive amount of email messages to a target.
   - **Email Spoofing**. Sending email messages with a forged sender address.
   - **Falsification of Data**. Modifying data to hide illegal activities.
   - **Age Discrimination**. Discriminating against a person because of his or her age.
   - **Sexual Harassment**. Making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors.
   - **Embezzlement**. Stealing money or property that has been entrusted to your care.
   - **Sabotage**. Destroying or damaging property to prevent a company from operating.
   - **Theft of Intellectual Property**. Stealing intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, and copyrights.
   - **Fraud**. Using deception to obtain money or property.
  
- Businesses can reduce the risk of litigation by
publishing and maintaining policies that
employees find easy to read and follow.
    - Example: 
      - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
      - Employee Handbook
      - Logon Banner
      - Privacy Policy

- Most important policies define rules for using the
company’s computers and networks
    - Known as an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

- **Line of Authority** is a chain of command that defines who reports to whom.

- Business can avoid litigation by displaying a
warning banner on computer screens

    - Informs end users that the organization reserves the
right to inspect computer systems and network traffic
at will

### Example of a Logon Banner

- During private-sector investigations, you must search for evidence that is relevant to the case and support allegations of violations of a company’s rules or an attack on its assets

- These are the types of situations are common
    - Abuse or misuse of company resources
    - Violation of company policies
    - Email abuse
    - Internet abuse
    - Intellectual property theft
    - Fraud

- A private-sector investigator’s job is to minimize risk
to the company


- The distinction between personal and company
computer property can be difficult with cell
phones, smartphones, personal notebooks, and
tablet computers

- Bring your own device (BYOD) environment
  - Some companies state that if you connect a
personal device to the business network, it falls
under the same rules as company property


# Maintaining Professional Conduct
- Digit/al forensics examiners must maintain professional conduct at all times.
- An investigator must exhibit the highest level of integrity and professionalism at all times.
    - Maintaining Objectivity
    - Maintaining Confidentiality
    - Maintaining Integrity
    - Maintaining Professionalism
    - Maintaining Competence

- Investigayors should also attend training courses and conferences to maintain their skills and knowledge and keep up with the latest developments in the field.

# Preparing a digital forensics investigation
- Computers can contain evidence or information that helps law enforcement determine:
    - Chain of events leading up to a crime
    - Who committed the crime

- Law enforcement officers must follow the law when collecting evidence.
    - Dgital evidence must be collected in a manner that does not alter the evidence.

- A potential crime scene can be a location where a crime was committed or a location where evidence of a crime may be found.

# Overview of a Company Policy Violation Investigation
- Employees misusing resprces can cost companies millions of dollars each year.
- Misuse includes:
    - Surfing the Internet
    - Sending personal email
    - Playing games
    - Using company computers for personal use


# Taking a Systematic Approach to Digital Forensics Investigation
- In General, steps to follow when conducting a digital forensics investigation:
    - Prepare for the investigation
    - Collect digital evidence
    - Analyze the evidence
    - Present the evidence
    - Document the investigation

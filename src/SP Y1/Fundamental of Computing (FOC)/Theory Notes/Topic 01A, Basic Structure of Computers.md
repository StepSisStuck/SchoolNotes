## Type of Topology 

>> Ring topology = LAN

>> Bus topology = LAN

>> Star topology = LAN 

>> Mesh topology = LAN

>> Tree topology = LAN

>Apache Server is a web server that runs on a computer and listens for requests from web browsers. When a request is received, the server sends back a response that contains the requested web page. The server can also send other types of files, such as images, videos, and documents. 

>> PHP, can have different scrpit tags, but the most common is <?php ?>. The PHP script is executed on the server, and the plain HTML result is sent back to the browser.

>>> My SQL, by microsoft to store data in a database.

>>>> Structer of a typical LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server.


The admin can do offsite or onsite administration. 

---------------------------

## A computer’s functions can be broken down into three basic tasks: 


> Input: A user types the letter ‘A’ on the keyboard, which results in sending a code representing the
letter ‘A’ to the computer

>Processing: The computer’s CPU determines what letter was typed by looking up the keyboard code
in a table

> Output: The CPU sends instructions to the graphics cards to display the letter ‘A’, which is then sent to
the computer monitor

They can use external input devices such as a mouse, keyboard, scanner, or camera. They can also use internal input devices such as a microphone or a touch screen. AKA Interfaces. 


----------------------------------
 ## These are the common items that are used as input devices: 

<h4>

> PS2 Mouse

> USB Mouse

> PS2 Keyboard

If muiltiple processors are used, they are called cores. Quartet core, octo core, etc.

They are also called muilticore CPUs to "Think faster"


CPU is the brain of the computer
CPU is the central processing unit of the computer

## Storage and Memory 


- Two types of memory:
Short term memory (RAM) and long term memory (ROM)

  - RAM is volatile, meaning that it loses its contents when the power is turned off.

  - ROM is non-volatile, meaning that it retains its contents when the power is turned off.

RAM are non volatile, meaning that they retain their contents when the power is turned off. 

If there is not enough RAM, the computer will use the hard drive as virtual memory. This is called paging.

They will transfer from the hard drive to the RAM when the computer is turned on.

When its not needed, it will be transfered back to the hard drive.

RAM is used to store the operating system, which is a program that is run when the computer is turned on.

Virtual memory is a feature of an operating system that allows a computer to use the hard drive as if it were RAM. This is called paging.

They can transfer which is a bus data from the hard drive to the RAM when the computer is turned on.

When its not needed, it will be transfered back to the hard drive.

---------------------------

## Long Term Storage
They use metal platters to store data.
Some use magnetic heads to read and write data.

Some use laser heads to read and write data.

If they have a bit of dust on the platters, it will cause the data to be corrupted.

CD and DVD are non volatile, meaning that they retain their contents when the power is turned off.

Some of them uses SSD (Solid State Drive) to store data.
They are non volatile, meaning that they retain their contents when the power is turned off.

They are faster than HDD.

A motherboard is a circuit board that connects all the other components of a computer together.

- They have a heat sink to cool the CPU.

- They have a power supply to provide power to the computer.

- They have a BIOS to store the boot sequence.

- They use a CMOS battery to store the BIOS settings.

- They have a chipset to connect the CPU to the RAM.

- They have a northbridge to connect the CPU to the RAM.
 
- They have a southbridge to connect the CPU to the RAM.

- They have a PCI slot to connect the PCI cards.

- They have a PCI-E slot to connect the PCI-E cards.

------------------------------
ROM are volatile, meaning that they lose their contents when the power is turned off.

ROM are used to store the BIOS, which is a program that is run when the computer is turned on.

--------------------------------

##  Computer Bus Fundamentals



A bus is a set of wires that connect the components of a computer together.

They are used to transfer data between the components of a computer.

There are buses between the CPU and the RAM.

  - Data Bus is used to transfer data between the CPU and the RAM.

   - Address Bus is used to transfer the address of the data between the CPU and the RAM.

- Control Bus is used to transfer control signals between the CPU and the RAM.

------------------------------
Difference between Address bus and Data bus

The address bus is used to transfer the address of the data between the CPU and the RAM.

The data bus is used to transfer data between the CPU and the RAM.

> I/O Polling and Interrupts

>I/O Polling is a method of transferring data between the CPU and the I/O devices.

> The CPU sends a request to the I/O device to transfer data.

>> The I/O device transfers the data to the CPU.

>>> The CPU checks if the data is ready.

>>>> If the data is ready, the CPU will read the data.

>>>>>If the data is not ready, the CPU will wait for the data to be ready.

>>>>>> Interrupts is a method of transferring data between the CPU and the I/O devices.


---------------------------

## What is BIOs? 




BIOS is a program that is run when the computer is turned on.

BIOS is stored in ROM.

BIOS is used to initialize the hardware components of the computer.

BIOS is used to store the boot sequence.

BIOS is used to store the CMOS settings.

---------------------------------

##  NIC Card


NIC stands for Network Interface Card.

They attach to the motherboard. They have a MAC address. Example: 00-0C-29-5A-5A-5A

They are used to connect the computer to a network using a wire, LAN

Wireless NICs, they are used to connect the computer to a network using a wireless connection

They use SSID to identify the network and connect to a wifi network.

They use WEP, WPA, WPA2 to secure the wireless connection.

They use DHCP to automatically assign an IP address to the computer.

They use DNS to translate the domain name to an IP address.

They can upgrade their conputer by adding more RAM, adding more hard drive space, adding more PCI cards, adding more PCI-E cards, adding more USB ports, adding more SATA ports, adding more IDE ports, adding more PS2 ports, adding more VGA ports, adding more DVI ports, adding more HDMI ports, adding more Ethernet ports, adding more Firewire ports, adding more Audio

## How can CPU cache can enhance the performance of a computer?

> CPU cache is a small amount of RAM that is located on the CPU.
     >> It is used to store the data that is used by the CPU like a RAM.
     >>> It is faster than the RAM.
     >>>> It is used to enhance the performance of the computer.
     >>>>>The more cache the CPU has, the faster the computer will be.

## Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal Codes



    Dec: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 -> base 10

    Binary: 0,1 -> base 2  [0,1]

    Octal: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -> base 8 [11-->000....111]

    Hex: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F -> base 16 [1111-->0000....1111]

> 1 Byte = 8 bits

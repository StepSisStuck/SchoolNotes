# Preparation for Incident Response
- An incident response plan is a set of instructions to help IT staff detect, respond to, and recover from network security incidents.
- Documented incident response plans are essential for organizations that must comply with government regulations and industry standards.
- Incident response teams are groups of people who are responsible for carrying out the incident response plan.
- Retention Policy - A retention policy is a document that defines how long data must be kept and how it should be disposed of securely when it is no longer needed.
- Stakeholder management is the process of identifying the people who have an interest in a project and ensuring that their needs are met.
- Communication is a key part of incident response. It is important to communicate with stakeholders and the public in a timely manner.

## Study attack Frameworks
Exploit frameworks are collections of software tools that provide pre-written, automated scripts to help identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems. They are used by both attackers and security professionals.
These are the common atatacks frameworks:
- Metasploit
- BeEF
- SET
- Empire
- Social Engineer Toolkit (SET)

# Incident Response
- Incident response is the process of detecting, responding to, and recovering from network security incidents.
- An incident response plan is a set of instructions to help IT staff detect, respond to, and recover from network security incidents.

-----------------
## Using SOAR Runbooks and Playbooks
- A security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform is a software solution that helps security teams manage the incident response process.
- A SOAR platform can be used to create runbooks and playbooks that automate incident response tasks.
- A runbook is a document that describes the steps that should be taken to respond to a specific type of incident.
- A playbook is a set of instructions that can be used to automate incident response tasks.
  -  A playbook focus more on the automation of tasks, while a runbook is more of a manual process.

-----------------
# Perform Containment
- Containment is the process of preventing an incident from spreading and causing further damage.
- A security incident is an event that could potentially cause harm to a computer system or network.
- A secure network design takes advantage of network segmentation to contain security incidents.
- Network segmentation is the process of dividing a network into smaller subnetworks.
- Network segmentation only restricts access to resources. It does not prevent an attacker from moving laterally within a network.
  -   When an attacks occures, isolate the infected system from the network to prevent the attack from spreading.


-----------------
# Make Configuration Changes
- Configuration changes are changes to the configuration of a system or network.
- To neutralize a threat, you might need to make configuration changes to a system or network.
- Configuration changes should be tested in a lab environment before they are implemented in a production environment.
- Configuration changes may need to be applied to the following
   - Firewall rules
   - Digital certificates
   - Content filtering
   - Access control lists (ACLs)
   - Data loss prevention (DLP) policies
   - Mobile device management (MDM) policies

-----------------

# Data Sources
- Data sources are the sources of information that can be used to detect security incidents.
- Data sources include the following:
  - Logs
    - Using data from logs to detect security incidents is known as log analysis.
    - Logs are records of events that occur on a system or network.
    - Logs can be used to detect security incidents.
  - Network traffic
    - Network traffic analysis is the process of analyzing network traffic to detect security incidents.
  - System files
  - System processes
  - System memory
  - System registry
  - System configuration
  - System state
  - System backups
  - System images
  - System snapshots
  - System baselines
  - System audits
  - System alerts
  - System reports
  - System metrics
  - System scans
  - System tests
  - System forensics
  - System monitoring
  - System sensors
  - System sensors
  - System sensors
  - System sensors
  - System sensors
